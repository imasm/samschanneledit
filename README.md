## NO LONGER MANTAINED
THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER MANTAINED.

> At this moment, I no longer have access to Samsung TVs, and I cannot test their latest models. For this reason, this project cannot provide further updates.
> Fortunately, there are currently better options, such as [ChanSort](https://github.com/PredatH0r/ChanSort).

! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK !
--------------------------

and is suppliedded "as is" without warranty of any kind, either express or implied. Use at your own risk.

Installation

There's no setup package, just download the zip file from [SamsChannelEditor](http://sourceforge.net/projects/samschanneledit/files),
extract all in a folder and execute ''samschanneleditor.exe''. 

This application is written in C# so you need the .Net framework 4.0 (or newer) to be installed on your computer.

Bad file size error
-------------------
Since version 0.9 you can define new sizes in SamsChannelEditor.exe.config. Just open with a text editor like notepad and add a new size for your file in section.

key: starts with "fs_" and after comes the channel file name (without "-" after map) value: is a number list separated by commas. Each number specifies a possible record size.

To calculate your record size:

* change extension .scm to .zip
* Extract all files.
* Select file you are opening and look the size in file properties.
* record size is a 1000 multiple (divide your size by 1000 or 2000)

### Example: ###

```xml
<appSettings> 
   <add key="fs_default" value="292,320" />
